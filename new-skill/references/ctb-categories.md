## How to Select the Right Category

### Step 1: Identify Dominant Theme
Ask: What is the primary transformation this email content offers?
- Energy/performance improvement → Category 1
- Value/leverage awareness → Category 2
- Operational freedom → Category 3
- Leadership mindset shift → Category 4
- Decision optimization → Category 5

### Step 2: Match CTA Promise to Theme
Each category has specific promise language aligned to Campaign Blueprint:
- Category 1: "operate at your cognitive best" / "shift how you think about high-performance work"
- Category 2: "identify $1,000/hour vs $10/hour activities"
- Category 3: "build businesses running without you"
- Category 4: "make you think like a Chief Leverage Officer"
- Category 5: "preserve mental energy for high-value decisions"

### Step 3: Create Unique Curiosity Bridge
Don't copy the examples - use them as structure guides:
1. Reference the specific insight from YOUR tweet
2. Show the gap between knowing and implementing FOR YOUR SPECIFIC TOPIC
3. Promise insights/perspectives (not systems)
4. End with link, nothing after

## Mixing Categories

Sometimes content spans multiple categories. Choose the PRIMARY theme, but you can blend promise language:

**Example blending Categories 2 & 3:**
```
Understanding leverage is one thing.

Building operational systems that automatically free your time for high-value work is different.

I share insights about business leverage and operational freedom in my daily email.

Join to get perspectives that help you identify $1,000/hour activities and build businesses running without you:

https://go.thepeakperformer.io/
```

**When to blend:**
- Content clearly addresses 2 themes equally
- The promises naturally complement each other
- It creates a stronger curiosity bridge

**When NOT to blend:**
- Trying to cram too many promises (max 2)
- Themes are unrelated
- It makes the CTA feel generic instead of specific

### ❌ Not Linking to Tweet Content

[Generic CTA unrelated to the specific tweet content]
